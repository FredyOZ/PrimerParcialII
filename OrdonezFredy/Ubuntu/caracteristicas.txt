Ubuntu on Windows allows you to use Ubuntu Terminal and run Ubuntu command line utilities including bash, ssh, git, apt and many more.

Please note that Windows 10 S does not support running this app.

To launch, use "ubuntu" on the command-line prompt (cmd.exe), or click on the Ubuntu tile in the Start Menu.

To use this feature, one first needs to use "Turn Windows features on or off" and select "Windows Subsystem for Linux", click OK, reboot, and use this app.

The above step can also be performed using Administrator PowerShell prompt:
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

This app installs the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS release on Windows.
